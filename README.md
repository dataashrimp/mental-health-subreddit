## Introduction

We have developed a data visualization dashboard designed for discussions on Reddit, with a new focus on geographical subreddits like r/NYC. The dashboard offers various data visualizations and analytics, providing insights into user interactions within selected subreddits. This dashboard can be used as a utility for moderators in understanding community dynamics and fostering engagement. Additionally, the tool can be used as a means for users to understand the general sentiments of people living in that city, assisting in decisions related to jobs or relocation. 

Models developed in this project could be useful in other machine learning/NLP projects or using other genres of subreddit data.
